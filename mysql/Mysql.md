# Node.js MYSQL

Node.js can be used in database applications.

To be able to experiment with the code examples, you should have MYSQL installed on your computer.

To access a MYSQL database with Node.js, you need a MYSQL driver.

To download and install the "mysql" module, open the Command Terminal and execute the following:

> `npm install mysql`

Node.js can use this module to manipulate the MySQL database:

> `var mysql = require('mysql')`
